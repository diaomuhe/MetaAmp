Your region is 286 bp including primer sequences. After trimming the primer sequences, your insert is only around 250 bp. so,  "Trim amplicon to a fixed length"  cannot be bigger than 250 bp. if your insert size is 250,  "Maximum number of mismatches in the overlap region" set to less than 6 (set to 5).
